        <h4>Ingridients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups uncooked short grain rice</li>
          <li>3 cups water</li>
          <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
          <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water until the water runs clear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover,
            and cook until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from stove and set
            aside until cool enough to handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the
            sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool. Then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear very wet at
            first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Prepare a small bowl of ice water with a splash of rice vinegar.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dip your hands into the water and use your damp hands to grab a small ball of sushi rice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using your hands, form the rice into a rectangle about as long as one slice of fish.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a chopstick, place a small dab of wasabi paste on the center of the rice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Top the rice ball with a slice of fish and gently squeeze the rice and fish together in one hand, using
                the index finger of your other hand to keep the fish in place.
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeat steps 7-10 with the remaining fish and rice.

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Get your fish.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pat the fish dry with a paper towel. Add 1 teaspoon salt (per pound) and let it sit for 20 minutes.
                You will see that water will start coming out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pay fish dry with a paper towel, and store in a freezer bag.
              </li>
              <li>
                Freeze fish for at least 7 days at 4°F (-20°C) to a month to kill parasites.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you're ready to eat the fish, defrost in the refrigerator the night before.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take fish out of the refrigerator before eating and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice and serve. I
                like to eat with sushi rice and dip with wasabi & soy sauce. If you have salmon skin left, don't throw
                it away. Fry in some oil for 5-7 minutes until crispy. It tastes like chips!
              </li>
              <li>
                Optional: I served the fish sashimi with yuzu aioli for a slight citrus note. You can also serve the
                sashimi with lemon, cucumbers, and avocado.

              <li>Crab, green onion, and sriracha</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Place your nori, shiny side down, on the bamboo rolling mat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover 2/3 of the nori (from the short end) with 1/3 - 1/2 c sushi rice. You'll want the rice layer about
                1/8" thick. If the rice is too sticky to spread easily, moisten your fingers with water before
                spreading.
                Lay filling ingredients in a nice line, 1/3 of the way up the nori.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take the bamboo mat and gently pull the bottom section (with just 1/3 of rice) up over the filling.
                Continue to roll the sushi, pulling the mat straight away from you to coax a nice roll. Once the roll is
                complete, pick up the mat with the roll and press firmly. This will press the rice in to position, and
                the last naked bit of nori will stick to itself, sealing the roll.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cut your roll using a large, sharp knife. If you find things sticking to the knife as you cut, moisten
                it slightly with a little water.
              </li>
              <li>
                Serve with pickled ginger, soy sauce, and/or wasabi as desired.

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>To make the filling</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Discard the thick core of green cabbage and cut it into thin strips about ⅓-inch (1 cm) wide.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finely chop the strips crosswise into very small pieces, especially the thick white parts of the leaves.
            Then, run your knife through the cabbage to mince it finer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle the minced cabbage with 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and massage together with your hands.
            Transfer it to a bowl and set aside until the cabbage is wilted. Tip: Alternatively, you can blanch or
            microwave the cabbage for a minute or two to soften the thick and hard leaves. Or, you can skip wilting
            altogether.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mince 2 green onions/scallions into small pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the stems from 2 shiitake mushrooms and mince the caps into small pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grate the ginger with a ceramic grater and add 1 tsp ginger (grated, with juice) to a small plate. Mince or
            press 2 cloves garlic (I use a garlic press) and add to the plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the green onions, shiitake mushrooms, and ½ lb ground pork in a large bowl. Now, add the seasonings:
            2 tsp sake, 2 tsp toasted sesame oil, 2 tsp soy sauce, and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix well and knead the mixture with your hand (I wear plastic disposable gloves) until it becomes sticky and
            pale in color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, squeeze the water out from the salted cabbage and add to the meat mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knead the mixture again with your hand to evenly distribute the cabbage into the meat.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To fold the Gyoza</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare a small bowl of water and a baking sheet either lined with parchment paper or dusted with 2 Tbsp
            potato starch (or cornstarch). Open 1 package gyoza wrappers and cover them with a damp towel or plastic
            wrap at all times so they don't dry out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place one wrapper in the palm of your non-dominant hand (left hand for me). Use a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop to
            place a small amount of filling in the center of the wrapper. Do not overstuff. (If you're new to gyoza
            making, use a scant 1 Tbsp of filling.) Flatten it with the scooper bowl, making sure to press out any air
            pockets in the filling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dip one finger in the water and use it to moisten a circle around the outer ¼ inch (6 mm) of the wrapper.
            Fold the wrapper in half over the filling. Pinch the wrapper together at the top center of the half circle,
            but don't seal it yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            This recipe shares the folding method with the pleats leaning toward the center. If you want the pleats
            leaning toward one side, check out my How to Fold Gyoza post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start on the right side near the top center. To make the first pleat, use your right thumb and index finger
            to fold the wrapper's top half into a pleat that leans toward the center. Use your left thumb and index
            finger to press the folded pleat tightly against the back half of the wrapper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat folding along the right side about once every ¼ inch (6 mm), making 3-4 pleats total.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press down the pleats to seal any gap.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue pleating the left side of the gyoza, starting near the top center. To make the first pleat, use
            your left thumb and index finger to fold the wrapper's top half into a pleat that leans toward the center.
            Use your right thumb and index finger to press the folded pleat tightly against the back half of the
            wrapper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat folding along the left side about once every ¼ inch (6 mm), making 3-4 pleats total.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press the pleats one last time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evenly distribute the filling and shape the gyoza to create a flat side on the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place your finished gyoza on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap to avoid drying. Repeat to fold
            the remaining wrappers.
          </li>

    </ul>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <h4>To prepare the steamed rice</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          To measure 2¼ cups uncooked Japanese short-grain white rice, overfill a US cup measure (a ¾-cup measure works
          well for this) or a rice cooker cup with uncooked short-grain rice and level it off. Put the rice in a large
          bowl. Repeat until you have the amount of rice you need. Tip: Please note that 2¼ cups (450 g, 3 rice cooker
          cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 6⅔ cups (990 g) of cooked white rice. This is enough for 9
          onigiri rice balls (typically 110 g each). One cup of cooked white rice weighs about 5.3 oz (150 g).
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, rinse and wash the short-grain white rice and cook it with a rice cooker, pot over a stove, Instant Pot,
          or donabe. Please follow the detailed instructions in any one of these posts for how to rinse and cook the
          rice. Here, I'm adding 2½ cups water to the drained rice in a rice cooker. Tip: The rice-to-water ratio is 1
          to 1.1 (or 1.2) for Japanese short-grain white rice. This rice requires a soaking time of 20-30 minutes.
          Please read this blog post for a detailed explanation.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>To prepare the onigiri fillings</h4>
      <h4>Japanese Salted Salmon:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place 1-2 fillet salmon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil (for broiling) or parchment paper (for
          baking). Sprinkle Diamond Crystal kosher salt on both sides
        </li>
        <li>
          Broil or bake at 425ºF (218ºC) in a toaster oven or standard oven for 10-20 minutes. Japanese salted salmon is
          cooked until well done (you want it dry and flaky). Break the cooked salmon into flakes and set aside.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Okaka:</h4>
      <li>
        Put 1 packet katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in a bowl and add 1 Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine. The
        katsuobushi should be moistened but not drenched in the soy sauce.
      </li>
      <h4>Tuna Mayo</h4>
      <li>
        Put 1 (5-ounce) can albacore tuna (preferably packed in olive oil), drained, in a bowl. Add 2 Tbsp Japanese
        Kewpie mayonnaise and ½ Tbsp soy sauce. Mix to combine.
      </li>
      <h4>Umeboshi:</h4>
      <li>
        Remove and discard the seed from 2 umeboshi (Japanese pickled plum) and put the umeboshi flesh on a small
        plate or bowl.
      </li>
    </div>
    <h4>Mentaiko:</h4>
    <li>
      Cut 2 sacs spicy salted pollock roe or cod roe (karashi mentaiko) in half and squeeze out the roe from the sacs
      with your hands or a knife. Set aside on a small plate or bowl.
    </li>
    <h4>Shio Kombu:</h4>
    <li>Put the prepared shio kombu in a bowl for easy access later.</li>
    <div>
      <h4>To shape Onigiri</h4>
      <div>
        <h4>With your hands</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, wet both of your palms with a bit of water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands. Then,
            apply
            some Diamond Crystal kosher salt and spread it on both palms. How much salt? I dip 2-3 fingers in the kosher
            salt, as pictured below. If you are using table salt, use half the amount as it's saltier than kosher salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop a handful (about ⅓ cup, 50 g) of slightly cooled but still hot rice onto your left (non-dominant)
            hand.
            Tip: Your left hand holds the rice ball and flattens the onigiri's sides. Always keep it underneath the
            onigiri.
            Create a small well (indentation) in the center of the rice. Add 1-2 tsp of one kind of filling inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoop some more rice (another ⅓ cup, 50 g) to cover your filling completely. Mold the rice with your hands
            and
            gently press the rice around the filling to form the rice into a ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bend your right (dominant) hand slightly to form a “mountain” shape and place it on top of the rice. Your
            right
            hand forms the triangle corners of the onigiri. Always keep it on top of the rice ball.
            Gently press the rice with your top hand to make a triangle corner. Tip: Make your hands just firm enough so
            the
            onigiri doesn't fall apart, but don't squeeze too tightly. Try to keep the density of the rice ball as airy
            as
            possible.
            At the same time, squeeze the fingers and heel of your bottom (left) hand on either side of the onigiri to
            gently press the sides flat.
            Now, rotate the triangle corner you just made toward you. I use a single upward motion to barely toss the
            rice
            ball in my bottom hand while I use my top hand to rotate it toward me clockwise (since I'm right-handed).
            The
            first corner will now point at you while the tip of the second corner points up.
            Repeat the “press and rotate” steps to form the second and third triangle corners. Then press and rotate 2-3
            more times to finish shaping the triangle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the rice ball on its side and press gently to flatten one side; repeat on the other side. Then, press
            and
            rotate one last time. Transfer to a baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the
            remaining
            rice.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Using plastic wrap</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you don't want to touch the rice with your bare hands, you can use this method. Also, use this method
            when
            you are packing onigiri for lunch. Place a piece of plastic wrap in a rice bowl (or any small bowl) and
            sprinkle
            some Diamond Crystal kosher salt (remember, salt is used here to preserve the rice for a long time).
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the rice on top. If you'd like to add a filling, create a small well (indentation) in the center of the
            rice. Put one kind of filling (about 1-2 tsp) inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, scoop some more rice to cover your filling completely and sprinkle some salt on top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather the corners of the plastic wrap and twist the plastic a few times to tighten it around the rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Form the rice into a triangle shape in the same manner that I described above. Garnish with furikake and/or
            nori, if desired.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>To coat with the furikake</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remember, dip your fingers before touching the onigiri to prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coat the three sides of the onigiri with furikake (rice seasoning).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>To wrap with th nori and serve</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Toast 3 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) over an open flame one by one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, cut them into thirds, parallel to the lines on the nori sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Style A: Wrap a strip of nori on one side of the onigiri. For this style, you may need to cut the nori into
          shorter and narrower strips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy the onigiri warm or at room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Style B: Wrap the onigiri with a piece of nori seaweed. If you like crispy nori, then wait to wrap the nori
          until right before consuming the onigiri. Make sure to keep the nori in an airtight container or bag so it
          will
          not get stale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a little bit of each filling on the tip of the onigiri so you can identify which filling is inside.
          Enjoy
          the onigiri warm or at room temperature.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>To store</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you'd like to pack Onigiri for your lunch, keep it cool and consume it within 6 hours. Onigiri (or any rice
          dish) gets hard when you refrigerate it. The cold air makes the rice dry and hard. I don't recommend making
          onigiri too far ahead of time. But if you really need to, my trick is to wrap the onigiri with thick kitchen
          towels and store it in the fridge. The onigiri will be cool and safe but should not get cold.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your onigiri has dried out a bit, you can grill it in a frying pan and baste it with soy sauce to make Yaki
          Onigiri.
        </li>

    <h2>Fluffy Japanese Pancakes</h2>
    <img src="images/jpCus/Fluffy-Japanese-Souffle-Pancakes-9332-I-1.jpg" alt="Japanese Souffle Pancakes">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)</li>
        <li>
          1½ Tbsp whole milk (I haven't tried reduced-fat, low-fat, nonfat, or plant-based milk for this recipe as I
          believe the batter will be too thin to make souffle pancakes)
        </li>
        <li>
          ¼ tsp pure vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>
          ¼ cup cake flour (weigh your flour or use the “fluff and sprinkle“ method and level it off; you can make
          homemade cake flour)
        </li>
        <li>
          ½ tsp baking powder
        </li>
        <li>
          2 Tbsp sugar
        </li>
        <li>
          1 Tbsp neutral oil (for greasing the pan)
        </li>
        <li>
          2 Tbsp water (for steaming)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the fresh whipped cream (optional)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ½ cup heavy (whipping) cream
        </li>
        <li>
          1½ Tbsp sugar (add more if you like it sweeter)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the toppings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, etc.)</li>
        <li>maple syrup</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>To Make the Fresh Whipped Cream (optional)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you'd like to serve the Fluffy Japanese Soufflé Pancakes with optional fresh whipped cream, make it now.
            First, prepare an ice bath: Put ice cubes and water in a large bowl and place a clean and dry medium bowl on
            top of the ice water. Add ½ cup heavy (whipping) cream and 1½ Tbsp sugar to the medium bowl to keep them
            cold.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk on high speed until medium to firm peaks form. The cream should not be runny but soft, fluffy, and
            firm instead. Keep the whipped cream chilled until you're ready to serve the pancakes.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To mix the batter</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Separate 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into whites and yolks in two different bowls. Put the bowl with
            the egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the meantime, add 1½ Tbsp whole milk and ¼ tsp pure vanilla extract to the egg yolks and whisk using a
            hand whisk until thick and frothy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sift ¼ cup cake flour and ½ tsp baking powder into the bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk to combine thoroughly; do not overmix. Set aside while you make the meringue.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To make the meringue</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Take one-third of the egg white meringue and add to the egg yolk mixture. Whisk together by hand (don't
            worry too much about breaking air bubbles at this point).
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, take half of the remaining meringue and add to the egg yolk mixture. Using a hand whisk, gently fold
            them in without breaking the air bubbles in the egg
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, transfer the egg yolk mixture back into the bowl with the remaining meringue. Very gently fold the two
            mixtures together, taking care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Mix
            the batter very gently until well combined and homogenous.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To cook the pancakes</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Keep your nonstick frying pan heated to 300ºF (150ºC) at all times over low heat. Remember, each pancake
            gets roughly four small scoops of batter, and you will be making three pancakes. For the first pancake,
            place one scoop of batter and make a tall mound in the frying pan, using a small ladle or a serving spoon
            (that's bigger than a regular spoon—probably 2-3 Tbsp). Next, stack one more scoop of batter onto the first
            scoop already in the pan. Repeat for the next two pancakes, giving each pancake two scoops of batter.
          </li>
          <li>
            By the time all three pancakes have two scoops, the surface of the batter is slightly dry already. At this
            point, you can mound one more scoop on top of each pancake, keeping the batter piled up high. In the bowl,
            you should still have roughly three scoops left (if you have slightly more, that's okay).
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the timer for 6-7 minutes and add 1 Tbsp of the 2 Tbsp water in three empty spaces inside the pan. Cover
            with a lid. The steam from the water keeps the pancakes moist while they cook. Please note: The suggested
            time is just a guideline; how long you will cook the pancakes is based on the temperature of your frying
            pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 2 minutes have passed, open the lid, and add one final scoop of batter to each pancake (or more scoops
            if you have more batter). Make sure to stack the batter high, not wide. If the water has evaporated, add a
            little bit more. Cover with the lid and cook.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 6-7 minutes have passed, lift the pancake VERY GENTLY using an offset spatula. If the pancake is
            stuck, don't touch it until it firms up a little. If you force it, the pancake will crack in the middle.
            When the pancake is ready, you can easily move the pancake. Repeat with the other pancakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here is another set of images to show the process. Slightly pull the pancake to create an empty space and
            gently flip it over with a “rolling over” motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add another 1 Tbsp water to the empty spaces in the pan and cover. Set the timer for 4-5 minutes to cook the
            other side on the lowest heat setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once they are nicely browned, transfer the pancakes to your serving plates.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <div>
        <h4>To serve and store</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place the optional fresh whipped cream on the pancakes and top with fresh berries. Dust your Fluffy
            Japanese Soufflé Pancakes with 1 Tbsp confectioners' sugar and drizzle with maple syrup. Enjoy!
          </li>
          <li>
            For the fluffiest texture, I recommend making these soufflé pancakes just before serving. If you have
            leftovers, transfer them to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>For the yakitori sauce ("Tare")</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>½ cup soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce for GF)</li>
          <li>½ cup mirin</li>
          <li>¼ cup sake</li>
          <li>¼ cup water</li>
          <li>2 tsp brown sugar (packed and leveled off)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>For the chicken skewers</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) (or 9 green onions)</li>
          <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (at room temperature)</li>
          <li>Neutral oil (for brushing the wire rack)</li>
          <li>Shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (optional; for a spicy kick)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all the ingredients. For this recipe, I use teppogushi or “gun skewers” that have a flat tab for a
          handle. You can buy them at Japanese markets or on Amazon. If you can't find them, you can use regular bamboo
          skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soak 10-12 5-inch bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separate the green part of 2 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) from the light green and white parts.
          Cut the white and light green parts into 1¼-inch (3-cm) pieces. Cut the green parts in half crosswise.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        <h4>To make yakitori sauce (Tare)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To a small saucepan, add ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup mirin, ¼ cup sake, and ¼ cup water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 2 tsp brown sugar and the green part of the Tokyo negi.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the
            sauce reduces to one-third of its original volume. It will take about 30 minutes. Let it cool to room
            temperature before using. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine as it cools. Tip: You can make the
            sauce ahead of time. To store, remove the green onion from the sauce and pour into a mason jar. Keep in the
            refrigerator for up to 2-3 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tip: If you want to serve your yakitori with extra sauce, reserve one-third of the sauce in a small bowl for
            final basting, just before serving. To prevent cross-contamination, use this reserved sauce with a clean
            brush only after the chicken is fully cooked.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To assemble the skewers</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs into 1¼-inch (3-cm) squares.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a flat work surface, fold a slice of chicken in half. Holding the skewer at a 45-degree angle, pierce the
            side of the folded meat. Then, tilt the skewer down so it's parallel to the work surface and push it all the
            way through. Position the chicken next to the handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, add a piece of Tokyo negi perpendicular to the skewer, packing it snuggly next to the chicken piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternate skewering the chicken and Tokyo negi pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            End with a piece of chicken. Each 5-inch skewer will hold about 3 chicken slices and 2 Tokyo negi pieces.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To Broil/Grill the Yakitori (recommended)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Place an oven-safe wire rack on top. Grease the
            grate of the wire rack with neutral oil to keep the chicken from sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the skewers on top in two rows, with the handles resting along the edges of the baking sheet. Cover
            the top and bottom of the handles with folded strips of aluminum foil to prevent burning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the broiler to High and wait until the heating elements are hot, about 3-5 minutes. Then, place the
            skewers under the broiler. Broil for 6 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 6 minutes, brush the meat and Tokyo negi with the yakitori sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip the skewers carefully with a pair of tongs. Brush on the other side with the yakitori sauce. Continue
            to broil for 3-4 minutes to caramelize the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, flip one more time (this is the presentation side). Brush with the yakitori sauce and broil for 1-2
            minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To Pan-Fry the Yakitori (optional)</h4>
        <li>
          Heat a large frying pan on medium heat. When it's hot, add about 1 Tbsp neutral oil. When the oil is hot,
          place the skewers in the pan in a single layer (you may have to cook in batches). Cook until both sides are
          brown, about 5 minutes each side. Then, cover and cook on low heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the sauce to the pan
          and cook until well coated. Remove from the heat.
        </li>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To serve and store</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfer the skewers to a serving plate, presentation side up. Optionally, with a clean brush, baste the
            top of the chicken skewers with the reserved sauce. Serve with shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) and
            enjoy!
          </li>
          <li>
            You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the
            freezer for up to a month.

    <h2>Miso Soup</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>For the Dashi</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>4 cups water</li>
          <li>1 piece kombu (dried kelp) (⅓ oz, 10 g per piece; 4 x 4 inches or 10 x 10 cm)</li>
          <li>1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>For the Miso Soup</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>7 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu)</li>
          <li>4 Tbsp miso (use 1 Tbsp, 18 g for every 1 cup, 240 ml of dashi)</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed</li>
          <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>Before you start</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I make Awase Dashi with kombu and katsuobushi in this recipe. You can also make dashi with a dashi packet
            or powder. For vegan/vegetarian, make the Kombu Dashi I showed below or make Vegan Dashi with kombu and
            dried shiitake mushrooms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather all the ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut 1 green onion/scallion into thin rounds.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To make the Dashi</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add 4 cups water and 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) to a medium saucepan. If you have time, soak the kombu in
            water for 30 minutes. NEVER wash kombu and do not remove the white substance—that's umami! These days, it's
            pretty clean, so just make sure there are no dirt particles.
          </li>
          <li>
            SLOWLY bring it to a boil (about 10 minutes) on medium-low heat so you can extract as much umami from the
            kombu as possible. Right before the stock boils, remove the kombu and set it aside for another use. (If you
            leave the kombu, it gets slimy and yields a bitter taste.) Now, what you have is Kombu Dashi. If you're
            vegetarian/vegan, use this kombu dashi for your miso soup.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're not vegetarian/vegan, add 1 cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) to the kombu dashi and bring it
            back to a boil again. Once the dashi is boiling, reduce the heat, simmer for just 30 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi sink to the bottom, about 10 minutes. Then, strain through a
            fine-mesh sieve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you have roughly 4 cups of Awase Dashi. You can store the dashi in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days
            and in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Reserve the spent katsuobushi and repurpose it; see the suggested
            recipes that follow at the end of the instructions.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To make Miso Soup</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the dashi to the saucepan. If you are using dashi from the refrigerator, bring it to a slow boil
            (205°F/96°C) over medium heat and turn off the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 4 Tbsp miso. Put the miso in a ladle, slowly add the dashi into the ladle, and stir with chopsticks to
            dissolve completely. Here, I'm using a miso muddler. If you accidentally add too much miso, dilute the miso
            soup with dashi (or water).
          </li>
          <li>
            After dissolving the miso in the strainer, you may see rice koji (especially when it's koji miso). It's up
            to you if you want to include it in the miso soup or discard it (personal preference).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut 7 oz soft/silken tofu (kinugoshi dofu) into ½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes and add to the miso soup. Tip: Add the
            tofu after the miso is completely dissolved; otherwise, you might break the tofu when stirring in the miso.
            Note: It is very common to cut tofu on your palm in Japan. However, I recommend using a cutting board if you
            have never done this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 1 Tbsp dried wakame seaweed and the chopped green onions to the pot right before serving to keep their
            fresh fragrance and color. Tip: If you worry about salt intake, I recommend rehydrating the dried wakame in
            a separate bowl of water to get rid of the saltiness, instead of rehydrating it in the soup itself. If
            reheating, warm up the miso soup until it is just hot. NEVER BOIL miso soup because it loses flavor and
            aroma.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Serve, store and reheat</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve immediately. Place on the right side of the table setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general, it's best to consume all the miso soup right away because it will lose its aroma and taste as
            time passes. Let your miso soup cool to room temperature (up to 4 hours; any longer and it will spoil) and
            then refrigerate. Keep for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. If you want to make a big batch to store for
            later, it's best to refrigerate the soup without adding the miso. When ready to use, add the miso only for
            the portion you need. You can freeze miso soup for up to 2 weeks. However, you have to remove the tofu
            before freezing as the texture will change.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat the miso soup in a pot over medium heat, but do not boil. Miso loses its nutrients, flavor, and aroma
            at high temperatures.
          </li>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Wash the bones in cold water with clean brush to remove blood. Put the bones in a strainer to drain the excess
          water.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large pot, add water, bones and kombu. Measure the distance from the top of the pot to the top of the
          water, make a note of this 'original water level'.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook over high heat to bring to a boil and keep boiling. Stir the stock with a long wooden spatula, scrape the
          bottom to prevent it from burning and to bring the scams to the surface. Skim the scams until they stop
          appearing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep boiling the stock for 4 hours, maintain the 'original water level' on (2) by periodically topping up the
          water so it remains the same. Stir the bottom of the pot to prevent it from burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the stock becomes milky and thicker after 4 hours, start reducing the stock. Do not add the water
          anymore. This is a process of thickening the stock by reduction. Keep boiling the stock until the volume is
          reduced to about half. During this phase, stirring frequently by scraping the bottom of the pot with the
          spatula as it can be burnt easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn off the heat, pour the stock over a strainer to another clean pot. In order to maintain the quality of
          the stock, it is advisable to cool it rapidly by putting the bottom of the pot into a pool of cold water. Keep
          the stock in the fridge if stored overnight.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        <h4>Aroma Oil</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut the pork back fat into small chunks.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a saucepan, add the pork back fat and cook over low heat until melted. It should take about an hour. Take
            care not to burn the oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the oil over a strainer into another saucepan. Discard the leftover dry pork fat. Add minced pork and
            minced garlic to the oil, cook over medium heat until the temperature reaches 135°C. Turn off the heat,
            leave to rest.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Char Shu Pork</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add pork and water in a saucepan, ensure the pork is submerged under the water. Cook over high heat for
            about 1 hour. If possible, use a meat probe and cook until the core of the pork reaches 70°C.
          </li>
          <li>
            While cooking the pork, prepare a marinade. Add soy sauce, Honteri, sugar, garlic, ginger and chilli in a
            saucepan.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the pork belly is cooked. Add 400ml of the pork cooking water to the marinade. Heat the marinade over
            low heat, stir to dissolve sugar. Add the pork belly, cook over low heat for an hour. Keep the pork
            submerged under the sauce. Alternatively, cook at 70°C in sous vide in a sealed bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the pork in the marinade in a Ziploc bag, remove air from the bag. Store in the fridge overnight.

    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) packages buckwheat soba noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut against the grain in thin strips</li>
        <li>2 cups carrots, cut into julienne strips</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, cut into julienne strips</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>

        <li>2 onions (large; 1.5 lb, 670 g)</li>
        <li>2 carrots (6.7 oz, 190 g)</li>
        <li>3 Yukon gold potatoes (15 oz, 432 g)</li>

      </ul>
      <div>
        <h4>For the Curry sauce</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1½ Tbsp neutral oil (for cooking)</li>
          <li>4 cups chicken stock/broth (for lower sodium, use water only or half stock and half water)</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp ketchup</li>
          <li>1 package Japanese curry roux (7-8 oz or 200-230 g; or make my Japanese Curry Roux)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>For serving</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>8 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
          <li>fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables) (optional; or make my Homemade Fukujinzuke)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>To prepare the ingredients</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into thick
            wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut creates
            more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peel 3 Yukon gold potatoes and cut them into quarters. Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess
            starch. Tip: Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape well. You can use russet potatoes, but they tend to
            disintegrate into the broth during cooking, so cut them into 6 pieces each and add to the pot toward the end
            of cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grate the ginger (I use a ceramic grater) and measure 1 tsp ginger with the juice. Set aside. Mince 2 cloves
            garlic and set aside (I use a garlic press later when adding to the pot).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut ½ apple into quarters, remove the core, and peel the skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grate the apple and set aside. Note: You also could use 1 small lunchbox apple for 8 servings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut off the extra fat from 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs and discard it. Then, cut the chicken
            into bite-sized pieces. I recommend cutting it diagonally (it's called sogigiri in Japanese) to create more
            surface area and flatten each piece so it cooks faster. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Tip: If you
            will use homemade curry roux, you can lightly season the chicken with kosher salt as well.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To cook the Curry</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don't
            stir the onions too often because they won't develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so we
            do not want to skip this step. If you have an extra 5 minutes, definitely caramelize the onions!
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well
            together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are
            getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half stock
            and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you're using my homemade curry roux, you don't need to worry as it
            does not contain salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to
            add). Please read my blog post for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you're using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15-20
            minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don't worry; we don't want too much
            liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>To add the Curry Roux</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1-2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly
            let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the
            blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip: I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for
            8-12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry
            roux, I typically use 6-7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn't solidified
            yet).
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5-10
            minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no
            roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you use my unsalted homemade curry roux, taste the curry now and add salt to your liking. Tip: I
            recommend adding 2-4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, but this will vary based on the brand of the chicken
            broth and condiments you added.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Serve, store and reheat</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with fukujinzuke
            (Japanese red pickled vegetables).
          </li>
          <li>
            You can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stains!) and store it in the refrigerator
            for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. The texture of the potatoes will change in the freezer, so
            you should take them out before freezing. Defrost the frozen curry in the refrigerator for 24 hours before
            you want to reheat it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leftover curry sauce will thicken into a paste as it cools, so it tends to burn while reheating. To avoid
            this, stir ½ cup (120 ml) water or more into the leftover sauce until loosened. Then, gently reheat it on
            low heat. If the sauce seems thin, continue heating with the lid off to reduce the sauce.
          </li>
        </ul>
