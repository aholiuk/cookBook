        <h4>For the Ratatouille</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 eggplant</li>
          <li>1 zucchini</li>
          <li>1 yellow squash</li>
          <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
          <li>2 tomatoes</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>

          <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Prepare the tomato sauce</h4>
          <p>
            In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and
            sauté until they become soft and translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried
            oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to
            meld together. Set the sauce aside.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Prepare the vegetables</h4>
          <p>
            Slice the eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and tomatoes into thin
            rounds of approximately the same thickness. This will ensure even cooking.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Assemble the ratatouille</h4>
          <p>
            Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Take a round baking dish or a cast-iron skillet and spread a thin layer
            of tomato sauce on the bottom. Arrange the sliced vegetables in an alternating pattern around the dish,
            starting from the outer edge and working your wat towards the center. Repeat this pattern until the dish is
            filled. Drizzle olive oil over the assembled vegetables and sprinkle minced garlic, dried thyme, salt, and
            pepper on top.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Bake the ratatouille</h4>
          <p>
            Cover the baking dish with foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the
            vegetables are tender and cooked through. Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the
            vegetables to slightly brown.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Garnish and serve</h4>
          <p>
            Once the ratatouille is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with
            fresh basil leaves for an extra touch of flavor and presentation. Serve the ratatouille as a main dish, a
            side dish, or even as a vegetarian centerpiece.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>For the Tarte Tatin</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>6 medium Honeycrisp apples</li>
          <li>30ml lemon juice</li>
          <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
          <li>200g sugar</li>
          <li>1 vanilla bean, halved and scraped</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon fleur de sel (sea salt flakes)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Make the crust</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the cubed butter and mix the ingredients together using your hands (rub between your palms) until you
              get a crumbly texture and pea-size bits of butter are still visible.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a small bowl, whisk together with a fork the egg yolk and lemon juice, and add to the other
              ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine until the dough comes together into a ball. If it feels too dry, you can add a 1 tablespoon of
              water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap in plastic film and chill until needed. (min 30 min, max 24).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Make the pie</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Peel, core and cut the apples in quarters. As you go, reserve the apple quarters in a large bowl with 30ml
              of lemon juice, to prevent them from browning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir the apple quarters as you go to make sure they're always lightly coated in lemon juice.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a 9-10 (22.9-25.4cm) cast iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, with the sugar and vanilla
              bean scrapings. Stir and cook for about 5 min, until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid starts to
              simmer. Add the apple quarters, stir to coat and turn the heat down to low.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover with a large sheet of foil (so the steam is kept inside) and cook for 20 min until the apples are
              tender (but not mushy), stirring occasionally and pouring the liquid in the pan on top of the apples
              (always place the foil back).
            </li>
            <li>
              With a slotted spoon or spatula, transfer the apple quarters to a cooling rack and sprinkle evenly with
              the sea salt flakes. Bring the heat to high and simmer the remaining liquid until it turns into a golden
              caramel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn your oven to 220°C (430°F)
            </li>
            <li>
              Take the crust out of the fridge, transfer it to a lightly floured working surface and roll it out to a
              30.5cm (12-inch) circle.
            </li>
            <li>
              When cool enough to handle with your fingers, place the apple quarters back into the skillet (over top the
              caramel) in a circular pattern, with the "outside of the fruit" side dowm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover with the crust and tuck the edges of the crust into the pan. Poke four tiny holes into the crust
              with a knife (for the steam to escape while baking).
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake for 10 min in the pre-heated oven. Turn the oven down to 190°C (375°F) and bake for 20 min,, until
              the crust is golden.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer the tart to a cooling rack for 5 min, and flip upside down onto a serving plate (do not wait any
              longer before you flip it, or the caramel will harden and the apples will remain stuck to the bottom of
              the pan). Use oven gloves or kitchen towels to protect your hands when you flip the tart as some remaining
              juice may still spill on the side of the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve warm (commonly with dollop of crème fraiche on top), or chilled.

        <h4>For the beef</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1.1 - 1.4kg stewing beef, cubed</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>

          <li>Optional: 6-7 sprigs parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>For the mushrooms</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>28.5g unsalted butter</li>
          <li>450g cremini mushrooms, quartered</li>
          <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
          <li>½ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 1</h4>
          <p>
            About 2 hours before cooking, pat the beef cubes dry with paper towels and season them well with salt and
            black pepper. Let rest to near room temperature.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 2</h4>
          <p>
            On the stove top, over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a Dutch-Oven. Add the bacon strips
            and cook for about 6-7 minutes, strirring occasionally, until fully cooked and lightly crisp. Set aside,
            leaving the fat drippings in the Dutch-Oven.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 3</h4>
          <p>Pre-heat your oven to 163°C (325°F) with a rack in the middle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 4</h4>
          <p>
            Working in batches, add the beef cubes to the Dutch-Oven and brown them, about 3 minutes on each side. Be
            careful not to overcrowd or overlap any meat cubes or they won't brown properly. It should take about 3 to 4
            batches. Transfer browned beef to a separate bowl or plate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 5</h4>
          <p>
            Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the Dutch-Oven and add the garlic, carrots, pearl onions and bay leaves.
            Cook for 6-7 minutes, until the onions are glistering.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 6</h4>
          <p>
            Add the beef and bacon back in the Dutch-Oven. Add tomato paste and sprinkle with the flour. Stir all the
            ingredients until no dry flour is visible. Pour in the red wine, brandy and beef stock so the meat is barely
            covered. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes in the oven.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 7 - While the stew cooks in the oven</h4>
          <p>
            Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, season to taste with
            salt and black pepper, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked and lightly browned.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <li>Take the Beef Bourguignon out of the oven and stir in the mushrooms. Return the pot to the oven for 30 more
          minutes. Take the Beef Bourguignon out of the oven, adjust seasoning if needed (salt, pepper). Let the Beef
          Bourguingnon sit for 15 minutes before serving</li>

    <p>(Old Fashioned Veal Stew)</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>900g veal (best cuts: breast, neck, shoulder, rib roast), cut into 5cm chunks</li>
        <li>2 liters water</li>
        <li>15 grams salt</li>
        <li>1 rib celery</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 sprig thyme</li>
        <li>1 onion, studded with 1 clove</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally</li>
        <li>12 baby onions</li>
        <li>90 grams unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>12 small white mushrooms</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>25 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>120ml heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley (for garnish)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large Dutch oven over medium heat high heat, heat the veal, water, and salt to boil then reduce to a
          simmer and let cook for 30 minutes. You will notice that a lot of scum will float to the surface. Use a spoon
          or a ladle to skim it off and throw it away
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the celery in half and sandwich your bay leaf and thyme in between. Tie with a piece of kitchen twine or
          string. Add the celery along with the studded onion and carrots. Let the veal slowly cook until the meat is
          insanely tender, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the veal is cooking, boil the small onions in boiling water for 2 minutes, or until the skins just pop
          off with the slightest pressure. Drain and remove the skins. Cook the little onions in a tablespoon of butter
          mixed with 60g of veal broth. Let cook for 5 minutes, or until the onions are tender. Let them sit
          until you are ready to finish the dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trim the ends off of your cleaned mushrooms. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small skillet. Add the mushrooms
          and cook gently being careful not to color them at all. Add the lemon juice and a ladle full of veal broth and
          let the mushrooms cook for 5 minutes, or until soft. Let them sit until you are ready to finish the dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the veal is tender strain the meat, keeping both the meat and the broth. Discard the celery and the
          onion. Keep the carrots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in your Dutch oven over low heat. As soon as it is melted add the
          flour and let cook very gently for 5 minutes. You do not want any color at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slowly add your veal broth to the flour mixture, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps. Add the nutmeg and
          taste. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring to a boil then return the meat and carrots to the dish along with your small onions and mushrooms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk together the eggs and cream then pour into the stew. Immediately turn off the heat. The eggs will
          thicken the broth slightly. The final consistency should be that of a light stew, not overly thick. Sprinkle
          parsley over and serve immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve directly from the pot with rice, boiled potatoes, or even buttered noodles.

        <li>400g of brown onions</li>
        <li>1 litre of stock</li>
        <li>50g of top quality unsalted butter</li>
        <li>100 to 200g of gruyere or comte cheese (grated)</li>
        <li>Several slices of French baguette or similar slightly toasted</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper for the seasoning</li>

    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Peel, wash and finely slice the onions (or use a food processor).
        </li>
        <li>

          Heat up the stock (homemade or top quality ready-made stock) and leave to simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a cast iron or thick bottom pan and add the onions. Stir well and season with salt and
          pepper. Then cook the onions on a medium heat for 30 minutes until brown (stir regularly to so the onions are

        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 230°C, with a rack in the upper third.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a cutting board, freeze the beef until it is firm on the outside but still easily pierced with a knife,
          about 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread baguette slices in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle the slices with olive oil or butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake on the upper third oven rack until crispy and golden brown, 10-15 minutes (watch closely, as ovens vary).
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the capers, cornichons, parsley, shallot, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon
          pepper, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, lemon juice, and 1 egg yolk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the beef against the grain, then cut the slices into thin strips (6 mm or
          thinner) and dice finely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the diced beef to the bowl with sauce and mix in to evenly coat. Season with salt and pepper to
          taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a serving plate, pat half of the beef into a round cookie cutter or ramekin. Repeat on a second plate with
          the remaining half of the beef tartare.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the back of a spoon, create a shallow well in the center of each steak tartare.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a raw egg yolk in the well of each steak tartare.
        </li>

        <h4>To finish</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 confit ducks legs</li>
          <li>60g goose fat or 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>2 cups plain dried breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The night before cooking, you need to soak the dried beans overnight. Simply place the beans in a large bowl
          and cover with 3 times their volume of water.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next morning, drain the beans completely and discard the soaking water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut up your pancetta into lardons (small cubes). If you buy the smoked pancetta sliced, make sure you ask for
          it thickly sliced, so the cubes are nice and thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the drained beans into a large pot, add the lardons, and cover with fresh cold water. Bring it to a boil
          and blanch for 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain everything in the pot into a colander and discard the cooking water. Set aside while you prep some other
          ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chop up the pork shoulder into 1″ cubes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chop up the onion, celery, carrots and tomatoes. Peel the garlic cloves, leaving them whole. At this point,
          preheat the oven to 120°C (250°F).
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the goose fat or olive oil in a 26cm flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the pork shoulder and
          brown for about 8 minutes. Lower the heat to low and then add the onions, celery, carrots and garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <li>
          While that is cooking, in a separate frying pan, brown the sausage for about 6-8 minutes in a little olive
          oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the sausage into chunks. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the tomatoes and bouquet garni to the casserole and cook slowly for about 5 minutes until the meat and
          vegetables begin to caramelize.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the sausage, beans, and lardons and pour in 1.2 liters water. Bring to a boil and skim off as much scum
          off the top as you can. Add the salt, pepper, clove and lemon juice. The water will be almost up to the top,
          but don't worry, it will reduce as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the casserole in the oven and cook, uncovered, for 2 - 2½ hours, stirring every hour. After 2 hours,
          check to see if the beans are soft and creamy and if the broth has thickened. If not, you may need to cook it
          another 30 minutes - 1 hour to get it to this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the casserole out of the oven and add the duck legs. Place them underneath the beans and vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the breadcrumbs on top and drizzle the goose fat or olive oil and garlic on top. Cook for an additional 2
          hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          After this time, the crumbs will have browned.
        </li>

        <li>6 duck legs</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Sprig of thyme</li>
        <li>4 cups of duck fat (available at specialty groceries)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 160°C (320°F).
        </li>
        <li>
          Season duck legs with salt and pepper. Place in a deep pan, with the duck legs on their side (arranged so that
          the sides with meat are touching each other). Cover with the warmed duck fat and add thyme and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a smaller sized lid on top of the duck legs (to keep them submerged in the duck fat), and place in the
          oven. Let cook for 2 hours total, removing at 1 hour to turn over the duck legs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven (taking care not to burn yourself with the duck fat), and rearrange the duck legs and
          completely submerge in the duck fat. Let chill until the duck fat solidifies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the duck legs from the solid duck fat, place in a baking pan and bake at 150°C (300°F) until the skin
          crisps up,

    <h2>Bouillabaisse</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2.3 kg assorted fresh fish, divided into firm- and soft-fleshed varieties</li>
        <li>2 crayfish</li>
        <li>1 baguette, sliced 1.25 cm thick</li>
        <li>120 ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes, peeled, cored, seeded, and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fennel fronds</li>
        <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
        <li>0.5 grams saffron threads, crumbled</li>
        <li>22 grams coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>0.5 grams (1/2 teaspoon) freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2-4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prep fish: Scale, gut, and wash fish, discarding gills. Keep the heads and other trimmings—they will flavor
          and thicken the broth. Very small fish can go into the bouillabaisse whole, while larger fish should be cut
          crosswise into 5 cm pieces, keeping the bones intact. Cut crayfish in half lengthwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 120°C (250°F). Lay bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast until crisp and
          dried-out but not brown, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onions, tomatoes, garlic, fennel fronds, bay leaf,
          saffron, salt, and pepper and sauté until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add firm fish and
          crayfish and stir to combine. Add enough boiling water to cover fish and vegetables, increase heat to high,
          and bring to a very strong boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil for 5 minutes, then add the soft fish. Continue to boil until the fish is cooked through and the broth is
          creamy, about 7 to 10 minutes longer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a slotted spoon to remove fish slices and arrange on a platter. Arrange bread in a deep vegetable dish and
          pour broth through a fine mesh sieve onto the bread. Moisten the fish with a ladleful of strained broth and
          sprinkle everything with parsley.

          Dutch oven to the stovetop and heat the bacon fat over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the chicken, skin
          side down, in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until brown on the
          other side, about 4 more minutes. (Don't overcrowd the chicken—work in batches if necessary, adding a little
          olive oil if you run out of rendered bacon fat.) Transfer the seared chicken to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the diced onion, carrot, and mushrooms to the Dutch oven and season with salt. Cook until the vegetables
          are lightly browned, about 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute, until it's fragrant. Add the reserved marinade.
          Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and reduce liquid to about half. Skim off foam as it appears.
        </li>
        <li>

          Add the chicken, pearl onions, and half of the bacon. There should be enough liquid to just cover the
          chicken—if not, add a little water or chicken stock. Cover and simmer over low heat until the chicken is
          tender, about 1 hour. Uncover, transfer chicken to a plate, and continue to simmer, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, whisk the flour and butter together into a smooth paste. Whisk the beurre manié into the stew to
          thicken. Continue to simmer until the sauce is thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 2 more
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed. Return the chicken to Dutch oven and simmer until warmed
          through, no more than 5 minutes. Remove from heat and garnish with remaining bacon and parsley.

        <li>30 g butter, cut into 6 pieces (2 tablespoons)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook the onions slowly in butter in a small saucepan for 5 minutes or so, until tender and translucent but not
          browned. Stir in the shallots or onions, and garlic, and cook slowly for 1 minute more. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dry the scallops and cut into slices 6 mm thick. Just before cooking, sprinkle with salt and pepper, roll in
          30 g of flour (sifted), and shake off any excess flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sauté the scallops quickly in very hot butter and oil for 2 minutes to brown them lightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the wine, or the vermouth and water, into the skillet with the scallops. Add the herbs and the cooked
          onion mixture. Cover the skillet and simmer for 5 minutes. Then uncover, and if necessary boil down the sauce
          rapidly for a minute until it is lightly thickened. Correct seasoning, and discard bay leaf.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon the scallops and sauce into the shells. Sprinkle with cheese and dot with butter. Set aside or

    <h2>Soufflé</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50g butter, plus a little extra for greasing</li>
        <li>25g breadcrumbs OR 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>4 medium eggs</li>
        <li>100g extra strong grated cheddar grated (You can also use blue cheese or goats cheese, to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oven to 180°C and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf. Butter a 15cm soufflé dish,
          then sprinkle in the breadcrumbs OR the Parmesan cheese (whichever you prefer) and shake the dish to make sure
          the crumbs/parmesan cheese are evenly spread and tip the rest out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter over a medium heat in a pan then stir in the flour and mustard powder. Keep stirring for about
          a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the pan off the heat and gradually stir in the milk, mixing it thoroughly. Return the pan to the heat and
          stir continuously for around 10 minutes until the mix becomes very thick. Transfer the mix to a bowl and allow
          it to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separate the egg whites into a bowl and fold the yolks into the sauce. Stir in the cheddar cheese and season
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk the egg whites until peaks form that hold their shape. Using a metal spoon, gently stir the whipped
          whites into the white sauce
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon the mixture into the greased dish. Run a cutlery knife around the edge to help the souffle rise above
          the rim and not stick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place on the baking sheet and bake for 25-30 mins until the top is golden and risen and has a slight wobble.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve immediately.

    <h2>Crêpes</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50 g of flour</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs (it works well with 3 eggs as well)</li>
        <li>500 ml of milk</li>
        <li>125g of butter</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the large mixing bowl, mix the flour and salt
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the eggs one by one while mixing with the whisk. You should get a fairly compact dough at the end
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the milk slowly slowly. This step is very important. If you add the milk too quickly, you will get a lot
          of lumps. Make sure the dough is slowly becoming a batter without lumps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in the microwave and add it to the batter. Keep mixing a bit
        </li>
        <li>
          Leave it to rest in the fridge for a couple of hours (that's the secret!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the ladle to pour the batter in the crepe pan. Move your pan so the batter is spread evenly. You generally
          need about 1 full ladle to make a crepe (again, it depends on the size of your equipment but it should give
          you an idea)
        </li>
        <li>
          Let it cook for about 2 mins and flip it.
        </li>
        <b>Pro tip:</b> you crepe is ready to flip when the edges start getting brown.
        <li>
          Repeat until there is no batter left.
        </li>

    <h2>Crème brûlée</h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div>
      <h3>Ingridients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>560 ml heavy whipping cream (35%)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean, halved and seeds scraped OR 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ cup (100g) sugar</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pre-heat your oven to 170°C (325°F) with a rack in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium saucepan, heat up the heavy whipping cream with the salt and vanilla seed scrapings (or vanilla
          extract). Do not bring the cream to a boil, just heat it up to let the vanilla infuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks with ¼ cup (50g) sugar. Pour 2 tablespoons of the hot
          cream into the egg yolk mixture and stir (this tempers the egg yolks so they don't curdle later). Slowly stir
          in the rest of the hot cream while continuously whisking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place 4 large (or 6 small) crèmes brûlées ramekins into a larger baking dish or sheet pan, and fill the
          ramekins with the crème. Fill the larger baking dish with water ¾ up the sides of the ramekins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the crèmes for 40 minutes. The edges should be set and the center should still jiggle slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully transfer to a cooling rack and let cool (ramekins still in the water bath). When cool enough to
          handle, transfer the ramekins out of the water bath and let cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle the remaining sugar onto each crème and tap the dishes around gently to make sure the sugar evenly
          covers the tops. Make sure no cream is left exposed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Caramelize the tops quickly using a blow torch. Let cool 30 seconds for the top to harden and serve
          immediately.

        <li>2 medium tomatoes or 1 large heirloom</li>
        <li>1 can tuna in oil (80g total, about 50g after oil drained) </li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper</li>
        <li>½ cucumber</li>
        <li>6 pink radishes bulbs</li>
        <li>½ large summer onion (white part only)</li>
        <li>50g Nicoises olives (or black olives), pitted or unpitted</li>
        <li>8-10 anchovy fillets, drained</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves, rougly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30ml) extra virgin oive oil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, peeled</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 1 - Make the hard-boiled eggs</h4>
          <p>
            In a small pot, cover the eggs with cold water by an inch. Heat the pot on high heat to bring the water to a
            boil. Turn off the heat, cover the pot with a lid (keep it on the hot burner) and let sit for exactly 10
            minutes. Drain the water, run cold water over the eggs to stop the cooking process and peel once cooled
            enough to touch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 2 - Prepare the lettuce</h4>
          <p>
            Tear the lettuce into large pieces. Wash under cold water and set aside on a cloth or paper towel to dry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 3 - Prepare the vegetables</h4>
          <p>
            Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized cubes, transfer into a bowl and toss with ½ tsp of salt so they render some
            of their juices. Set aside. Seed and cut the green bell pepper into thin strips. Peel and cut the ½ cucumber
            in half (lenghtwise), seed the inside by gliding the tip of a spoon across the length of the flesh, and cut
            into ¼-inch thick half-rounds. Slice the radishes into thin slices. Cut the summer onion into thin slices
            (discard ends). Peel and cut the hard-boiled eggs in quarters.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 4 - Assemble the salad</h4>
          <p>
            Rub the cut garlic clove onto the bottom of two serving plates. Place lettuce pieces evenly onto the plates.
            In a large bowl, stir together the fava beans, green bell peppers, cucumber, radishes, green onions, olives,
            and diced tomatoes - keep the juices aside. Scatter evenly onto the two plates. Top with equal parts of
            anchovies, tuna chunks and finally the halved eggs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Step 5 - Make the dressing</h4>
          <p>
            Stir 2 tablespoons (30ml) of extra-vrigin olive oil with the remaining juice of the tomatoes. Add chopped
            basil leaves, salt and pepper to taste and drizzle the dressing onto each plate, just before serving.
